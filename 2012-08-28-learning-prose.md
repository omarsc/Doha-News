# Learning prose

Inspired by [Development Seed](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2012/07/27/build-cms-free-websites/), I wanted to see how easy - and fast - Prose.io is to use as a text interface.

**Simpler** than HTML, and definitely worth exploring to create a new platform for [Doha News](http://dohanews.co) and other news sites.

> Prose.io and Jekyll enable building simple, flexible, and reliable without the overhead of dynamic CMSs (no more)

Very cool.
